Note that Salnity and Temperature are one. (Technically temp and conductivity.)

New parameters for the overview

- Barometric pressure
- Water temperature
- Depth: sensor to surface
- Tide: depth plus site-specific offset so they average.

Original parameters are:

Every Vulink:
- Battery (operator)
- Air Temperature (not too important)
- Barometric pressure (important)
- Elevation (how is this set, or is it computed - from GPS?)

Every AT500:
- Disolved Ox
- Salinity
- Water temp (built-in)
- Water pressure (built-in)

Princess:
- standard

Silver:
- standard

BDock:
- standard

Field Station:
- standard (at both surface and bottom)
- Chloro-A (Surface)
- pH (Surface)
